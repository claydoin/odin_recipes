    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These Best Ever Banana Nut Muffins are the BEST banana muffins you'll ever make, with a delicious and sweet walnut topping! </p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>4 large ripe bananas</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>
            <li>3/4 cups chopped walnuts</li>

        </ul>

     <h3> Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and prepare a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners (or grease very well with butter or cooking spray if you prefer not to use paper liners).</li>
            <li>Mash the bananas in a large bowl and mix in the sugar and egg with a wooden spoon until well blended.</li>
            <li>Add the vegetable oil and mix well. </li>
            <li>Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg, along with 3/4 cup of the chopped walnuts. Adding the walnuts with the dry ingredients helps prevent over-mixing.</li>
            <li>Mix everything together just until the flour disappears and the walnuts are distributed evenly throughout the batter. </li>
            <li>Spoon the muffin batter evenly into the 12 muffin cups </li>
            <li>Bake for about 20-23 minutes, or until the muffins are golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the muffins comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Let the muffins cool in their tins for a few minutes before removing them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
